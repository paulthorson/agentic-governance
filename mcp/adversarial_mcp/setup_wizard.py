"""
setup_wizard.py — Conversational setup wizard for agentic governance.

Per Section 9 of the ratified spec (docs/agentic-governance-spec.md):

- The wizard is CONVERSATIONAL, not a script. It is exposed through the MCP
  server as tools the operator's agent invokes. Questions are asked natively
  in whatever tool the operator is using, with labeled options wherever the
  answer set is bounded. Nothing is filled in by hand; no config file is
  authored manually.
- Answers are written to config/setup.md and config/roster.md.
- The final step generates one persona block per roster row into
  config/personas/ (Section 9.4 template).
- It is re-runnable. Absent or incomplete config is the UNKNOWN state; the
  wizard never defaults a value.

State machine: two MCP tools drive it.
  - setup_wizard_start()   -> begins (or resumes) the wizard, returns the
                              first (or next pending) question.
  - setup_wizard_answer(v) -> records the answer to the current question and
                              returns the next question, or the completion
                              summary when all questions are done.

State is persisted to config/.wizard-state.json so a long-running or restarted
server can resume mid-wizard, and so an incomplete config is never mistaken
for a complete one.
